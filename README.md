# Mysterious Mushrooms #
A Stardew Valley mod utilizing SMAPI and Harmony to revert the change made in 1.4 to how mushroom floors are generated in the mines.  
Now mushroom floors will regenerate when moving to floor 0 so you can farm them to your heart's content.  
This does not change the rules for spawning the mushroom floor, so tools like Stardew Predictor are still handy (https://mouseypounds.github.io/stardew-predictor/).
